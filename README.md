# Snowball Porter ES6

A JavaScript ES6 port of the Snowball compiler's generated JavaScript implementation. See https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball

## Description

This is a modern JavaScript port of the compiler-generated JavaScript stemming algorithms from the Snowball project. The original JavaScript code is generated by commit version 7c2511e (14 Mar 2025) of the Snowball compiler, which translates the Snowball algorithm into various target languages including JavaScript. This port updates the compiler-generated code to use ES6 modules and classes while maintaining the exact same stemming functionality.

You can just import it in your React project. Ideal for client side keyword search.

## What is Stemming?

Stemming is a text normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form, called a "stem". For example, words like "connection", "connections", "connective", "connected", and "connecting" are all reduced to the stem "connect". This is particularly useful in search systems, as it allows a search for one form of a word to match documents containing other forms of the same word, improving search effectiveness.

## Usage

```javascript
import SnowballEn from './SnowballEn.js';

const stemmer = new SnowballEn();

// Example usage
console.log(stemmer.stemWord('running'));  // Outputs: 'run'
console.log(stemmer.stemWord('conditional'));  // Outputs: 'condit'
console.log(stemmer.stemWord('happiness'));  // Outputs: 'happi'
